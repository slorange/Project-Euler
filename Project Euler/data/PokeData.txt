Tyranitar
- What a dominating force, and an outstanding member of the base 600 club. Absurd base 134/95/61 attack stats and a wide movepool are backed up by amazing 100/110/100 defenses. With Sand Stream, he brings permanent Sandstorm to the field, and is the only auto-weather user available. It's not all sunshine and roses (sand and rocks?) for him, as he has weaknesses to Ground x2, Water x2, Bug x2, Steel x2, Grass x2, and Fighting x4 make him vulnerable to a fair amount of pokemon. He's so bulky though that it's nearly impossible to OHKO him.
- Bulky, Faster, special, physical, mixed. Everything is possible.

Moves to be wary of
- Rock Slide, EQ, Brick Break/Focus Punch, Aerial Ace, Crunch, Fire Blast, Ice Beam, Surf, Rest, Thunderbolt

Checks and Counters
- STAB Brick Break is the only thing that can OHKO him (except Marowak's EQ). Machamp is his one true counter, as he resists both of Tyranitar's STAB, while easily OHKOing with Cross Chop. Other Fighting types also work well, and usually outspeed Tyranitar, but take hits less easily.
- Marowak can take any hit (except Blizzard/Surf) and either outspeed or tank another hit and easily OHKO with EQ.
- It's near impossible to tank Tyranitar effectively, as it can always carry a coverage move for you.
- Having said that, without Game Corner, Bulky Waters can handle Tyranitar without Thunder. This only applies to Vaporeon, Kingdra, and Politoed though, since every other bulky water has another type that Tyranitar can take advantage of.
- Poliwrath gets a bonus for being both Fighting and a bulky water. He can also set up easily with Bulk Up.
- Physical walls handle physical sets, while special walls handle the special set.
- Snorlax with Brick Break can handle Tyranitar's without Brick Break and significant Attack investment.

Dragonite
- My favorite pokemon in RBY, and one of my all-time favorites. Like Tyranitar, he's also in the base 600 club, albeit with a different distribution of stats. Base 91/95/100 defenses back up base 134/100/80 attack stats, making him slightly more offensive. He also has better typing, as he gets an immunity to Ground, and is only weak to Rock, Dragon, and Ice. Like all the base 600ers, he has an incredible movepool and can do damn near everything for your team.
- Like Tyranitar- he can be almost anything except stat-up sweeper right now.

Moves to be wary of
- Brick Break/Focus Punch, EQ, Aerial Ace/Wing Attack, Fire Blast, Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, Surf, TWave, Safeguard, Rest.

Checks and Counters
- Anything that gets STAB on Ice attacks will easily OHKO him, no matter the base stat. Non-STAB Ice Beams aren't guaranteed, although non-STAB Blizzards mostly are.
- STAB Rock Slide also deals with him well. Aerodactyl can switch in on EQ or Fire Blast, and survive a Surf to 2HKO. Dragonite can't be flinched, however, so don't try to rely on that. Tyranitar also gets STAB Rock Slide, and can switch in on Fire Blast/Blizzard/Thunder, but usually gets outsped, so it helps if Draggy has prior damage.
- Like Tyranitar, he's really hard to wall effectively, since his movepool is huge. It just depends on what attack he has. Bulky Waters can take out non-Thunder types. Forretress/Scizor can set up on Dnites without Fire Blast.


Posted Image
Snorlax
- The definition of a tank, this guy has good base 110 Attack to go along, with fantastic base 160 HP and 110 Special Defense. Almost every team you encounter will either have this guy or Blissey.
- There are multiple ways he can be used. He can be bulky or offensive, with a pretty good movepool. With the advent of the move relearner, he can also get Belly Drum for an all out offensive.

Moves to be wary of
- Body Slam, Earthquake, Brick Break, Rock Slide, Shadow Ball, Double Edge, Belly Drum, Fire Blast (for Scizor, Skarmory, Forretress), Psychic, Surf (for Rhydon/Golem)

Checks and Counters
- Anything that gets STAB fighting can easily force a switch. Machamp, Hitmonlee, and Heracross make great switch-ins to Body Slam, since Champ/Cross gets a Guts boost from paralysis while the latter is immune to paralysis.
- Strong, physical attacks in general scare him.
- Skarmory/Forretress wall every physical move, and only really fear Fire Blast.
- Gengar is immune to most of his moves, and can force him out with Focus Punch/Brick Break or beat him one on one with Hypnosis. Watch out for Psychic/Rock Slide though.
- Dusclops with Will-o Wisp and Focus Punch can beat him by forcing a Rest with burn damage (and burn reduces it's attack by half, too)
- Snorlax is prey for anything that can stat-up and take a hit (Slowbro, Scizor, Bulk Up users)
- Leech Seed Exeggutor with sleep powder has the defense and the recovery to beat it.
- Without Brick Break, Tyranitar can take you out, even if you have EQ.


Posted Image
Blissey
- The best wall in the game hands down, and the 2nd half of the dreaded SkarmBliss. With a MASSIVE base 255 HP (!!), top-notch base 135 Special Defense, and Softboiled, most special attackers don't stand a chance.
- Blissey can spread status to support the team (Toxic or Thunder Wave), or can sweep with Calm Mind.

Moves to be wary of
- Calm Mind, Water Pulse, Thunderbolt, Refresh, Thunder Wave, Toxic, Seismic Toss, Psychic, Fire Blast, Ice Beam

Checks and Counters
- Like Snorlax, anything that gets STAB fighting easily beats Blissey, even more so than Snorlax. Machamp/Heracross make an amazing switch-in, with Toxic/Thunder Wave activating Guts.
- Strong Physical attackers will scare her out (even more so than with Snorlax)
- Mixed attackers are really the key here. Unexpected Focus Punches can really punish Blissey (think Charizard, Nidoking, Gengar)
- Until Natural Cure gets implemented, Toxic makes Blissey much harder to keep in battle. In fact, the only real answer special attackers have right now to Blissey is Toxic, so be on the lookout for it.
- For Blisseys without Thunder Wave or Special attacks, Gengar and Dusclops ruin their day.
- Speaking of Dusclops, Will-o-Wisp + Focus Punch beats all Blissey (just burn and then FP until she has to heal with Softboiled.)
- Tyranitar doesn't mind paralysis, and can hurt hard with Physical Attacks.


Posted Image
Slowbro
- Easily the most dangerous set-up sweeper at the moment. Fantastic 95/110/80 defenses and good base 100 Special Attack allow him to abuse Calm Mind and sweep. His Dual-STAB off Psychic and Water are very effective right now, and compliment each other well.
- Some Slowbros can run curse, but for the most part Calm Mind is the set that's used.

Moves to be wary of
- Psychic, Surf, Fire Blast, Calm Mind, Rest

Checks and Counters
- Nothing can really take Slowbro one-on-one once he has enough Calm Minds up. The key to dealing with him though is to take advantage of his Rest.
- Toxic is an excellent way of forcing Slowbro to use rest quickly. Once he's asleep, there are multiple ways of dealing with him. The easiest way is to phaze him out with Roar/Whirlwind. Many pokemon can use one of these moves in the 4th moveslot.
- Users of Megahorn (Nidoking) really put the hurt on Slowbro, and both are faster than Slowbro. However, neither can take even one hit from him (even unboosted).
- Marowak's EQ will 2HKO it, but can't take a hit.
- Strong electric users can 2HKO Slowbros that are only at +2 Calm Minds, and take the +2 Psychic/Surf. Think Jolteon, Electabuzz, Magneton. The last 2 need some defensive investment to survive, however.
- Calm Mind Blissey with Shock Wave and Toxic shuts this thing down completely.
- Umbreon can come in easily and force a Rest with Toxic/Bite.
- Depending on the moveset, one of these pokemon can handle him easily.
- For Surf/Psychic, Exeggutor and Cacturne beat up Slowbro (especially with leech seed).
- For Surf/Fire Blast, any bulky water (Vaporeon, Gyarados) can tank hits.
- For Fire Blast/Psychic, Houndoom absolutely wrecks him. Tyranitar can also come in as well.
- In fact, Starmie deals with any moveset and can KO back with Thunder.
- Tyranitar can come in and set up Sand Stream, which Slowbro hates because it takes away Lefties recovery. STAB Crunch and immunity to Psychic also let him deal with Slowbro just fine, while taking little from unboosted Surfs.


Posted Image
Starmie
- A simple, amazing pokemon. Sky high 115 Speed with great base 100 Special Attack, dual STAB, and an awesome movepool make this a threat to be feared.
- Right now, straight up attacker is the only real moveset. However, Cosmic Power and Recover are both possible instead of 4 attacks, while Toxic/Thunedr Wave/Confuse Ray all help spread status. With the advent of Rapid Spin, bulkier spinning Starmie could see a rise in usage

Moves to be wary of
Surf, Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, Psychic, Recover, Cosmic Power, Toxic, Thunder Wave, Confuse Ray, Rapid Spin

Checks and Counters
- Blissey/Snorlax/Umbreon easily tank any hits and can deal big damage back.
  - Note however that Toxic + Recover puts a number on Blisseys without Refresh.
- Jolteon is faster and easliy one shots it.
- Alakazam is also faster and 2HKO's with Shock Wave.
- Depending on the moveset, various pokemon can beat it.
- Without Blizzard, Exeggutor/Cacturne deal with it easily.
- Without Thunder, any bulky water (Vaporeon, Gyarados, Slowbro) deals with it easily.
- Starmie also hates paralysis, since it's rendered near useless.


Posted Image
Marowak
- Oh boy. A seemingly mediocre pokemon, but with the item Thick Club his attack stat is DOUBLED, giving him a max attack stat of 290. Yeah, you read that right. 290. His Earthquake moves mountains, opens oceans, and puts the serious hurt on your pokemon. Rock Head also lets him use Double Edge just in case you thought you could fly over the EQ.
- This guy goes all out attacker, while the rest of his EV's go in to either his 60/110/80 defenses or his subpar base 45 Speed. Right now, the former seems to be more popular.

Moves to be wary of
- EQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQ
- Rock Slide, Aerial Ace, Double Edge, Brick Break (I don't like it, but it's there), Focus Punch, Swords Dance
- EQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQEQ

Checks and Counters
- He's slow, so faster special sweepers can OHKO him, but none of them can take Earthquake or Double Edge.
- Finally, a concrete answer to Marowak: Skarmory. The only way Marowak can beat Skarmory is with a predicted Focus Punch (even this does ~55% Not with Swords Dance you don't. A much riskier play for Skarmory to come in (not impossible though).
- Gengar is a safe switch-in. Immune to EQ, Double Edge, and any fighting moves, he can also tank an Aerial Ace or Rock Slide and get the health back with Giga Drain or disable him with Hypnosis.
- In general, faster sleep users help greatly against him.
- You can burn him with Dusclops, but Marowak will still down him easily, and you have to take a full powered EQ to do it. Even with burn, he'll still have an attack stat of around 145.
- Weezing is Immune to EQ, resists Fighting, and has base 120 defense to really tank Double Edge nicely. He doesn't have Will-o-Wisp yet, but can learn Fire Blast to do good damage, and Explode to take Marowak out of the match with him.
- Marowak is almost guaranteed to take one pokemon down, but it is easy to revenge kill. Not with Skarmory he isn't.


Posted Image
Gengar
- Maybe the most versatile pokemon in the game, this guy can do almost anything. With sky high base 130 Special Attack, great 110 Speed, 4 amazing immunities (Normal, Fighting, Ground, and Toxic), and the most unpredictable movepool this side of Dragonite/Salamence/Tyranitar, he's scary as all hell.
- He can be a special sweeper, he can be a physical wall breaker relying on decent Attack (65) and super effective attacks, he can put stuff to sleep. You never really know with him.

Moves to be wary of
- Thunderbolt, Psychic, Giga Drain, Shadow Ball, Brick Break, Focus Punch, Hypnosis, Explosion (!), Sludge Bomb

Checks and Counters
- Different pokemon counter different sets, but it can be really hard to tell what set it has without losing a pokemon.
- Umbreon can stand up to anything bar max Attack Focus Punch pretty easily and force him out with SE STAB Bite.
- Although they can only switch in to Brick Break/Psychic, Starmie and Alakazam are both faster than it, and can OHKO with STAB Psychic.
- Most Gengars have Focus Punch or Brick Break, which make Snorlax and Blissey risky switch-ins.
- Hypno may be the safest switch-in. Immune to Hypnosis, bulky enough to take anything except Shadow Ball (and can even take one or two of those), and can OHKO with STAB Psychic.
- Dusclops can tank most hits and OHKO with STAB Shadow Punch.
- The biggest problem when dealing with Gengar is that he can put your main counter to him to sleep (except for Hypno), and very few things can easily take multiple hits from Gengar. Much easier to revenge kill though, since Starmie and Alakazam will always be faster.
- Watch out for paralysis
- Until Substitute is implemented, Tyranitar can switch in on anything except Focus Punch and easily punish with STAB SE Crunch.


Posted Image
Skarmory
- The most terrifying physical wall in generation 3, and the other half of the dreaded SkarmBliss combo. A fantastic base 140 Defense combined with no physical weaknesses and a host of resistances and immunities means good luck trying to kill him physically.
- A strong, physical wall with Spikes is standard.

Moves to be wary of
- Spikes, Roar, Rest, Steel Wing/Aerial Ace, Toxic, Taunt

Checks and Counters
- He's weak to Fire and Electric, so anyone who gets STAB on those typically make a great check.
- Strong neutral special attacks also help force him out.
- The only way to really counter Skarmory is to surprise it from a mixed attacker. Physical attackers that otherwise wouldn't bother with Fire Blast pack it just for Skarmory. This includes Machamp, Snorlax, Weezing, Tauros, among others. It usually takes off a good chunk of health and forces Skarmory into making a difficult decision.
- Swords Dance sweepers can just pound on Skarmory the turn he uses Roar, and will eventually whittle him down.
- Rapid Spin users make great switch-ins, as they usually force a switch to a spin blocker. But Starmie is the only one that can actually hurt Skarmory (unless you run, like, Zap Cannon Forretress or something).
- Mix Tyranitar and Draggy can hurt you if you try to tank them.


Posted Image
Aerodactyl
- An amazingly fast physical sweeper, tied with Jolteon and Crobat for the second fastest Speed (base 130) in the game (behind Godtrode), and arguably the best of the 3. Good base 100 Attack lets him sweep with a good movepool. Cool typing gives him Dual-STAB on Rock and Flying, with a great ability in Rock Head that lets him abuse Double-Edge. Earthquake rounds off the set to nail Electric and Steel types.
- Right now all-out attacker is the only relevant set, and is just waiting for choice band.

Moves to be wary of
- Double Edge, Earthquake, Rock Slide or Ancientpower (I prefer Rock Slide), Aerial Ace, Hyper Beam (I don't like it, but some people use it)

Checks and Counters
- The biggest problem with Aerodactyl is that his neutral moves have trouble OHKOing a lot of his checks. Later on, Choice Band will remedy this.
- Slowbro just outright tanks everything Aerodactyl can throw at it, and then either set up with Calm Mind or just kill it with Surf. Other bulky waters (except Gyarado-) can also come in easily.
- Max defense Blissey can actually switch in and 2HKO it with Shock Wave/Water Pulse while only being 4HKO'ed by Double Edge.
- Steelix/Cloyster/Rhydon/Golem/Forretress/Marowak/Skarmory can switch in to damn near everything (including Earthquake/Rock Slide) and force it out with Iron Tail/Surf/Rock Slide/Roar.
- While not able to switch in to a damaging move, Gengar and Starmie will survive a hit from Aerodactyl and OHKO it with a super effective move.
- Bulk Up Poliwrath gives him problems.
- Watch out for paralysis.


Posted Image
Charizard
- Nearly everyone's favorite starter, he's gone up in usage as people realize how threatening Mixzard really is. Great all around 84/109/100 attack stats make him a dragon to be feared.
- Most Zards you enounter will run a mixed attacking set, so standard walls have a hard time dealing with him.

Moves to be wary of
- Flamethrower/Fire blast, Brick Break, Earthquake, Rock Slide, Focus Punch, Dragon Claw, Wing Attack, Swords Dance

Checks and Counters
- Slowbro is probably the safest switch-in. With high defense and a resist to Fire, Slowbro can switch in with impunity and easily force it out.
- In fact, any bulky water can easily come in and scare Charizard away. This includes Starmie.
- Swords Dance Charizard will hit most of the bulky Waters for about ~75% with EQ.
- Umbreon can take any non-fighting moves with ease and Toxic/Confuse it.
- Aerodactyl can switch in to anything but Rock Slide and force it out with STAB AncientPower/Rock Slide.
- Gengar has an easy time coming with immunities to Earthquake and Brick Break, and can take any of his other hits and OHKO with Thunder.
- Marowak can switch in to any physical attack and easily OHKO with Rock Slide.
- Rhydon/Golem can tank an EQ/BB and OHKO with Rock Slide.
- Watch out for paralysis


Posted Image
Jolteon
- One of the fastest meta-game sweepers in the game, with outstanding base 130 Speed that surpasses even Gengar, on par with Aerodactyl and Crobat, and great base 110 Special Attack, you should be wary of its electrifying attacks!
- Watch out for STAB Electric moves, it surely packs a punch and can easily sweep a team even without thunderbolt!

Moves to be wary of
- Thunderbolt, Bite, Thunder Wave, Toxic, Roar (I don't like it, but it's there)

Checks and Counters
- Sadly, Jolteon's move revolves around electric types, so being on the defense you should swap into a Ground type or a Sp.Def. Wall. Pokemon like Marowak/Nidoking/Golem/Hitmonlee/Hitmonchan/Blissey/Snorlax/Umbreon/Dusclops are prime examples. In particular, Ground types are an easy choice because it's a free, low damage switch-in.
- Jolteon is also quite fragile, with a base def of 60 and normally you wouldn't see anyone input too much EV points into defense. Heavy hitters can knock it out quite easily.
- If you have no ground types to nullify the Electric damage, you can try running Electrode with Thunderwave to slow Jolteon down a notch. Finish it off with faster pokemon!


Posted Image
Jynx
- A rather dangerous pokemon if you're not prepared for it. With great base 115 Special Attack, good base 95 Speed, awesome offensive typing (Ice/Psychic), and an interesting movepool including the most accurate sleep move available in Lovely Kiss, she'll wreck you if you're not prepared.
- Most people go with max speed and max special attack, but it's possible to make her more specially defensive.
- An important note: the only way to get Jynx is through an in-game NPC trade, so the IV's are the same for all Jynxes out right now (natures can vary, however). The IV's are 18/17/18/22/25/21.

Moves to be wary of
- Ice Beam, Psychic, Lovely Kiss, Fake Tears, Calm Mind

Checks and Counters
- The biggest issue with Jynx is that she can easily put your counter for her to sleep, and proceed to outmuscle it with Calm Mind.
- Having said that, Snorlax is easily the best counter to it. With great special defense and the ability Thick Fat, he can come in multiple times and force Jynx out, or OHKO-2HKO (depending on your EV's). For the absolute counter, you can put Snore on him to make Jynx useless against him. (not necessary though)
- Slowbro also makes an awesome switch in, resisting both of Jynx's STAB's while being able to Calm Mind up with her. However, if she can put you to sleep she will beat you.
- Hypno makes a great counter. With great Special Defense, immunity to sleep, and resisting her most powerful attack, Hypno can come in easily, and either Calm Mind up, Seismic Toss her, or scare her out with Focus Punch.
- Dusclops with Shadow Punch makes him a really good check to Jynx.
- Blissey/Umbreon shrug off even boosted attacks, and can counter with Seismic Toss, Toxic, or Thunder Wave, but can't do much about being put to sleep.
- Houndoom also makes a safe switch-in, and with Dual super effective STAB, can let you be unpredictable in how you take her down. Early Bird helps with sleep as well, and because of the Jynx's static IV's, Doom will usually outspeed her.
- Starmie makes a decent stop-gap with dual resists, but can't do much to Calm Mind Jynx.
- Strong Physical attacks take her down easily, if all else fails.
- Watch out for paralysis
- Tyranitar can switch in at will against her and scare her off easily.


Posted Image
Houndoom
- A very popular pokemon, this guy wrecks face. Like Jynx, has great base 110 Special Attack and 95 Speed, and good offensive dual STAB in Dark and Fire. Although he has lees utility than Jynx, he makes up for it with a much better offensive movepool.
- Max speed and special attack is what to watch out for, although some people run a bulkier Houndoom with special defense investment.
- With Flash Fire, he can easily come in on a predicted Fire move and get a boost to Fire attacks.

Moves to be wary of
- Crunch, Flamethrower, Solarbeam, Sunny Day, Roar

Checks and Counters
- Both Blissey and Snorlax make excellent switch-ins, and can easily force him out.
- Without Sunny Day, Starmie can come in on any move except Crunch and OHKO it with Surf. However, Sunny Day makes Surf a 2HKO, while Doom can OHKO with Crunch.
- Tentacruel makes an appearance here, with great special defense and STAB Surf, it handles Houndoom easily.
- Charizard can come in on any move and OHKO with any physical move. He also loves the Sunny Day Houndoom sets up.
- Poliwrath can come in on any move except Solarbeam and force it out. Bulkier Poliwraths can actually take 1 Solarbeam (at full health), and OHKO with Brick Break.
- Machamp/Hitmonlee resists Dark, easily OHKO's it, and loves the burn chance from Flamethrower/Fire Blast to activate Guts.
- Aerodactyl/Gyarados resists Fire, and easily OHKO's with Earthquake.
- Houndoom has to be careful about switching in to Alakazam. If Zam Calm Minds as you switch in, Crunch is no longer a guaranteed OHKO, while Shock Wave becomes a 2HKO, so you will lose.
- Basically, anything with a super effective attack (especially a physical one) will easily OHKO Houndoom.
- Watch out for paralysis
- Tyranitar resists both his STAB's, and can ruin the Sunnybeam set by coming in on a predicted Solarbeam. Sand Stream removes the sun, forcing Houndoom to stay in, and he's easily KO'ed.


Posted Image
Dodrio
- A fast, powerful physical sweeper. With base 110 Attack and 100 Speed, this bird will mow you down if you're not prepared. The only good pokemon right now with STAB Drill Peck (Fearow sucks), and STAB Tri-Attack (let's you get hax-y with status effects), this guy is a unique sweeper.
- He can go all-out max Attack max Apeed, or he can run an agility set that lets him go max Attack and max HP, making him surprisingly bulky.

Moves to be wary of
- Drill Peck, Tri-Attack, Agility, Steel Wing, Hyper Beam

Checks and Counters
- Unfortunately for our 3-headed friend, he has a pretty bad movepool. He can't learn a single attack that can hit Steel for even neutral damage. As such, Steelix, Skarmory, and Magneton make the best counters easily, being able to take multiple hits and deal back big damage (Magneton can OHKO easily). However, they don't like the status that Tri-Attack does to them (Freeze for both, Burn for Steelix).
- Anything with a strong SE attack will OHKO all versions, and most strong neutral attacks will take out the Max speed Dodrio. However, Max HP Dodrio pushes most of these OHKO's to 2HKO's, meaning he can set up Agility the first turn and sweep the second.
- Although with very good Attack and high powered moves, he has trouble netting full-health OHKO's on neutral damage targets. A pokemon at full health can revenge kill a Dodrio attempting a sweep.
- Dodrio plays pretty simply: he can't OHKO most pokemon, but he 2HKO's or 3HKO's nearly every pokemon, and mostly gets 2HKO'ed by most pokemon. Handle him accordingly.
- Watch out for paralysis
- Tyranitar laughs off even Steel Wing and can OHKO with STAB Rock Slide.


Posted Image
Alakazam
- An incredibly one dimensional pokemon. With massive base 135 Special Attack and 120 Speed, his STAB Psychic hits like a truck. His great attack stats are offset by his equally bad 55/45/85 defenses.
- There's only one real set to be run- Calm Mind sweeper, with very little variation.

Moves to be wary of
- Psychic, Calm Mind, Recover, Shock Wave, Thief

Checks and Counters
- He gets destroyed by the game's special walls. Snorlax takes little from Psychic and easily 2HKO's or even OHKO's. Blissey takes even less, and can hit it with crippling Toxic or Thunder Wave, or Calm Mind up with it. Hypno can sleep it and bring it down with Focus Punch/Meditate (minimally invested Hypno's Focus Punch is at worst a 4HKO, usually a 3HKO, better with Meditate boosts or investment). Umbreon is immune to Psychic and can Toxic it.
- Bulky Steel types wall it pretty hard, as they resist Psychic and take little from Shock Wave. Steelix is the best of these, as it's immune to Shock Wave as well.
- Rhydon/Golem can come in on a Shock Wave, survive an unboosted Psychic and OHKO with EQ.
- Houndoom is a pretty safe switch-in, but if Zam CM's on the switch, then Crunch becomes a 2HKO, while Shock Wave can now 2HKO if you've taken any damage.
- Alakazam will lose the Calm Mind battle with Slowbro, but +1 Shock Wave hurts a lot.
- Jynx can sleep it, and then proceed to Calm Mind up.
- Tyranitar has no problems switch in.


Posted Image
Rapidash
- Another mediocre fire type. Like most Fire types in this gen, he gets high Attack but no physical STAB and a terrible physical movepool (Flareon is the king of bad Fire types). However, Rapidash does have some things going for it. Base 105 Speed is pretty good, and base 80 Special Attack is alright. He's also faster than the other Fire-type SunnyBeamer (Houndoom), and can Bounce.
- All-out attacker, pretty much. Rapidash, for one reason or another, can't use it's cooler moves, so this is it.

Moves to be wary of
- Fire Blast, Solarbeam, Sunny Day, Rest, Bounce, Double-Edge

Checks and Counters
- Special walls counter him easily. Blissey and Snorlax don't really fear his physical attacks either.
- Houndoom beats it because of it's STAB Crunch, while Rapidash can do little back.
- Machamp/Marowak/Gyarados are bulky enough to take a hit and OHKO with EQ.
- Aerodactyl is faster than it, resists Fire, and will OHKO with EQ.
- Charizard also beats it with EQ, and then can abuse the Sunny Day you set up.
- However Rapidash needs Sunny Day, because without it he falis to get needed OHKO's on stuff.
- Here comes Tyranitar, ruining another weather-dependent pokemon. He can trap you if you Solarbeam when he switches in.


Posted Image
Tauros
- The raging bull, this guy used to be king of RBY metagame (where Hyper Beam was actually good). Right now, he's still good but gets walled hard by some common threats. Nevertheless, his base 100 Attack and 110 Speed and really good, and base 75/95/70 defenses gives it some decent bulk.
- Surprisingly, I've seen both all-out attacker and bulky sweeper with Rest.

Moves to be wary of
- Body Slam/Double-Edge, EQ, Rest, Rock Tomb, Hyper Beam (I don't like it, but it's there.), Fire Blast

Checks and Counters
- Forretress/Skarmory wall him completely. Resisting his Normal STAB and with high Defense, Tauros can do little to them.
- Gengar is immune to everything but Rock Tomb and Pursuit (lol), and with Hypnosis and Focus Punch makes a consistently safe switch-in.
- Aerodactyl resists Normal, is immune to EQ, and forces to rely on the inaccurate and subpar Rock Tomb.
- Cloyster has the Defense to take multiple hits, and attack Tauros' weaker Special Defense.
- STAB Fighting put the hurt on him, and Machamp is bulky enough to take a hit or 2 and then proceed to OHKO him. Bulk Up Poliwrath boosts his Defense and can 2HKO with boosted STAB SE Brick Break.


Posted Image
Dugtrio
- The greatest Revenge Killer in all of Pokemon outside of Wobbufett. With Arena Trap to prevent your opponent from switching out while Dugtrio is in play. But Arena Trap doesn't work yet, which brings our friend here down to niche usage at best for the time being.
- Still one of the fastest pokemon in the game at 120 base speed, even without its signature ability, only losing to Electrode/Jolteon/Crobat/Aerodactyl and tying with Alakazam. Still packs a very strong STAB Earthquake as well as a respectable set of usable moves with 80 attack.
- Resistance to Thunder Wave makes it tough to slow Dugtrio down, and it can switch in on basically anything the current electric types in PokeMMO can throw at it and scare them out.
- 30/50/70 Defenses are a joke, do your damage quickly and get out of there because Dugtrio cannot take a hit at all.

Moves to be wary of
- Earthquake, Rock Slide, Aerial Ace, Sludge Bomb, Body Slam/Slash/Return/Frustration, Toxic.

Checks and Counters
- Once Arena Trap works, there will be no true "counter" to Dugtrio, as you are unable to switch out, and your opponent will not keep Dugtrio in once the job is done. But for now...
- Skarmory, Cloyster and Forretress outright laugh at anything Dugtrio can throw its way, and can start setting up spikes.
- Any reasonably bulky pokemon that isn't weak to Earthquake should be able to switch in and OHKO Dugtrio fairly easily. Bulky waters like Vaporeon/Lapras/Blastoise are all good choices, though you really don't need a super effective move to take down Dugtrio 95% of the time.


Posted Image
Heracross
- A very cool pokemon. He has great base 125 Attack to wreck stuff with, good base 85 Speed, and solid base 80/75/95 defenses. He also gets the fantastic Guts ability. With the only user of STAB Megahorn, he easily handles a lot of pokes that give typical Fighting types trouble. Watch out.
- Either speedy or bulky sweeper.

Moves to be wary of
- Brick Break, Focus Punch, Earthquake, Megahorn, Rock Slide, Facade, Endure/Reversal, Swords Dance, Bulk Up

Checks and Counters
- His typing makes him 4x weak to Flying, so anything packing Aerial Ace can get an easy OHKO on him.
- Gengar of course makes a great switch-in almost always, as it's immune to everything but Rock Slide and can do a ton of damage with Psychic. He also gets a nice 4x resist to Megahorn, making him even more valuable in walling him.
- Weezing/Skarmory can come in on any attack and force it out with Fire Blast/Aerial Ace.
- Without EQ, bulky Tentacruel makes a great switch-in, resisting both STAB's, and can set up on it easily.

Espeon
- A slightly bulkier version of Alakazam. In the Eevee power rankings, she's 3rd right now (behind Umbreon, Vaporeon, and slightly ahead of Jolteon), but she's not a threat to be trifled with. STAB Psychic coming off Base 130 Special Attack hurt. Her base 110 Speed is really good as well, speed-tying with threats like Gengar. She has nice base 95 Special Defense as well. Although she's not near Alakazam's zone of frailty, she's not a defensive stalwart. She's also hindered by a bad movepool. Still, she can surprise teams that expect Alakazam, so watch out.

Moves to be wary of
- Psychic, Bite, Morning Sun, Calm Mind, Sunny Day

Checks and Counters
- Tyranitar is easily the best switch in. Resisting every move but Dig (lol), his SandStream destroys Morning Sun's efficacy. Giving Tyranitar basically a free turn to set up is never good for you team.
- In general, Dark types wreck Espeon. Umbreon 
- Special walls laugh at Espeon's attempts to set up. 
- Strong Physical attacks down it easily.

Crobat
- The coolest pokemon around. A direct inverse to how annoying Zubat is =3
- Speed. Speed speed speed. Base 130 Speed is nuts, speed-tying with Aerodactyl and Jolteon. Beyond that, he's actually a well-rounded pokemon. Base 85/80/80 defenses is pretty good for such a fast pokemon, and base 90/70 attack stats aren't too bad. Immunities to Ground and Toxic make him a much easier switch-in than Aerodactyl/Jolt, and he has a decent movepool to back it up.

Moves to be wary of
- Sludge Bomb/Poison Fang, Aerial Ace, Confuse Ray, Haze, Double-Edge, Steel Wing, Shadow Ball

Checks and Counters
- Paralysis is his biggest fear, followed closely by Burn.
- Barring that, STAB SE attacks can OHKO him. Without STAB, it's not guaranteed.
- Jolteon beats him one-on-one, regardless of who goes first. Aerodactyl as well if Crobat lacks Steel Wing, and even then if Aerodactyl is faster he wins.
- He can't do much at all to Steel types. Steelix/Skarmory/Forretress/Scizor all switch in with impunity.
- He has problems breaking through dedicated walls, having to rely on Confuse Hax to get through.

Victreebel
- A very strong sweeper in both physical and special attacks and a fantastic option for a physical sweeper in a Sunny Day composition.
- Great attacking stats in 105/100/70 allows him to hit hard on all fronts. Powerful STAB moves and access to Swords Dance are guaranteed to blast holes through the enemy team. Sleep Powder and Synthesis also give him strong utility.
- Thanks to Chlorophyll, a speed stat of 198 (101 in lvl 50s bracket) allows him to outspeed every Pokemon in the game when Sunny Day is up, minus maximum speed Electrode. In addition to this, he gets 1-turn STAB Solar Beams.
- Hard to use as anything other than a physical/special/mixed sweeper.

Moves to be wary of
- Sludge Bomb, Solar Beam, Giga Drain, Double-Edge / Body Slam, Swords Dance, Sleep Powder, Synthesis, Sunny Day.

Checks and Counters
- Steel types defend against every damaging move Victreebel can throw at them, with immunity to Sludge Bomb and resistance to Grass and Normal moves. Scizor can come in and set up freely, Forretress and Skarmory don't care about anything and can set up Spikes for free. Steelix also defends against his physical moves quite nicely, but he'll still get dented hard by neutral Solar Beams.
- Ghosts resist Sludge Bomb and are immune to Double-Edge. Gengar especially is also resistant to Solar Beam, while Dusclops doesn't mind tanking them too much.
- Poison types resist both his STABs. Weezing in particular also has the defensive bulk to withstand multiple Double-Edges while being able to fight back with Fire Blast.
- Without Double-Edge / Body Slam, Crobat resists both of his STAB moves and will scare him away with Flying type moves.
- Stalling out the Sunny Day / neutralizing it with your own weather brings Victreebel's speed back down to earth.
- Lowish defenses and bad defensive typing means he'll be crushed by just about anything that isn't Grass.


Posted Image
Slowking
- Slowbro's smarter older brother, he's basically Slowbro with the Defense stats switched. Unfortunately, this makes all the difference in the world, as Calm Mind synergizes much better with Slowbro's Defense than Slowking's Defense.
- However, 95/80/110 defenses are still nothing to sneeze at, and he still has the great base 100 Special Attack to use. He can catch people off guard, as he usually gets full Special Attack EV's, making him hit harder off the bat than Slowbro.
- Slowking can run any set Slowbro can, to different effectiveness.

Moves to be wary of
- Surf, Psychic, Fire Blast, Calm Mind, Ice Beam, Rest, Curse, EQ, Focus Punch/Brick Break, Shadow Ball, Headbutt/Strength/Double-Edge, Thunder Wave

Checks and Counters
- What makes CalmBro so powerful is that he only has 2 physical weaknesses that are hard to take advantage of, while Calm Mind covers his other, super weaknesses. CurseKing can't cover those special weaknesses as well as CalmBro can take his physical ones.
- Snorlax can beat the Calm Mind set with max Attack, something that Slowbro doesn't care about. Slowking also needs max Defense max HP just to make it happen.
- Curse set gets beaten by SE special moves.
- Most of the ways you use to take care of Slowbro do a better job with Slowking.
- Skarmory owns Curseking.


Posted Image
Politoed
- The lesser poli evolution (until gen 5). Standard fare here. An otherwise average bulky water with a few cool moves in Hypnosis and Focus Punch. Base 90/75/100 defenses and Water Absorb help with his bulkiness, while average 75/90/70 does leave physical options open.
- Bulky Politoed, either the Tank or the Wall variety. Loses all the nice speed Poliwhirl had.

Moves to be wary of
- Hypnosis, Surf, Ice Beam, Focus Punch/Brick Break, EQ, Psychic, Rest, Rain Dance, Toxic

Checks and Counters
- Blissey/Snorlax wall him well, as un-STAB'ed Brick Breaks off base 75 Attack don't do much to them. Watch out for Hypnosis/FP combo though.
- Slowbro/Slowking is a better counter. Resisting everything in his arsenal, Slowbro/Slowking easily comes in and sets up all day on the Toed. He doesn't even care about being put to sleep that much.
- The other bulky Waters fare well against him as well. Starmie/Lapras can hit with Thunder (especially if they switch in to Rain Dance), Vaporeon is more likely to carry Toxic to stall him out.
- Strong Physical attackers can break through his guard, typically bulky Fighting types.
- Gyarados has an easy time coming in with nice high Special Defense.
- Electric types need to watch out for EQ, but STAB Thunder is a 2HKO on all Politoed.
- Another weather user that has to watch out for Tyranitar. It's not as bad, since you can still switch out/set up Rain again/attack, but uninvested Surfs in Sandstorm do NOT scare Tyranitar.


Posted Image
Ursaring
- As fearsome as he looks. With base 130 Attack a good physical movepool, and decent 90/75/75 defenses, he's found himself a comfy home in the metagame.
- Either all-out attacker or bulky set-up sweeper. Can't get SD yet, which is a shame. With Swords Dance now implemented, he makes one hell of a wallbreaker. Guts makes him super scary.

Moves to be wary of
- Body Slam/Double-Edge/Facade, EQ, Rock Slide, Rest, Snore, Bulk Up, Brick Break/FP, Aerial Ace, Swords Dance

Checks and Counters
- Ursaring suffers from 4 moveslot syndrome, as it could really use 5 moves. The lacking move is how you should attack him.
- Without Swords Dance, Skarmory beats him. Ursaring really needs Swords Dance to beat the bird.
- Without Rock Slide, Gengar completely owns you. And even with it, Gengar can sleep you and launch Focus Punches until you die.
- Without EQ/FP, Steelix gets the better of him, as Brick Break won't do enough damage to kill.
- Without Rest, Ursaring gets worn down easily by repeated attacks.
- Without Body Slam/Double-Edge/Facade, Weezing ruins your day.
- Without Bulk Up, he gets walled and phazed easily.
- Without Aerial Ace, Heracross can come in and threaten him out.
- If no EQ or BB, Tyranitar can ruin your day.


Posted Image
Tentacruel
- PokeMMO's secondary resident tentacle monster and stall Venusaur's worst nightmare.
- A high base SpDef of 120 lets him wall many special attackers, and a decent base 80 SpAtk and water STAB allows him hit back with force. He also comes packed with a surprising base 100 speed (!).
- Being the only Liquid Ooze holder in our meta, he can surprise a lot of people by switching into predicted Leech Seeds and Giga Drains. His poison typing also gives him immunity to Toxic.
- He can be used as an all-out attacker, with high investment into SpAtk and Speed. Alternatively, he can be built as a staller with Toxic, or a set-up mixed wall with Barrier. We unfortunately don't have access to Sludge Bomb yet, so making use of his Atk stat and poison STAB will be difficult. When breeding becomes available, he'll also have access to Rapid Spin.

Moves to be wary of
- Surf/ Hydro Pump, Ice Beam, Giga Drain (!), Barrier, Toxic, Rain Dance, Sludge Bomb, Swords Dance

Checks and Counters
- Starmie will tear through him with SE STAB Psychic and/or SE Thunder while outspeeding him in the process. Just beware of predicted Giga Drains.
- Gengar also outruns Tentacruel and can nail him with Psychic or Thunder, but won't take a STAB Surf too well.
- Exeggutor can hit hard with SE STAB Psychic and also put Tenta to sleep, but not before being smacked by Blizzard.
- Special walls take care of him quite easily. Snorlax in particular can hit him with SE EQ while the scariest thing Tenta can throw at him is Toxic, but even then Snorlax can just Rest it off or laugh at it if he has Immunity instead of Thick Fat. Hypno doesn't like Toxic, but easily tanks every other move and can hit with STAB SE Psychic. Blissey with Thunder, Calm Mind/Shock Wave, or T-Wave/Seismic Toss will also beat Tentacruel.
- Scizor can come in on anything but Surf and set up, especially against bulkier, stall Tenta's.
- Any physical attacker that can switch in safely and hit Tenta with anything that isn't Fighting is guaranteed to hit hard, thanks to Tenta's lowish base Def of 65 and base HP of 80. Machamp and Ursaring also welcome the Toxic for Guts boost, should they face a stall Tenta. This may prove more difficult if the Tenta predicts your switch and begins setting up Barrier stacks.


Posted Image
Poliwrath
- Look everybody, it's the legendary fighting Mexican toad! .....
- With that out of the way, let's begin. A very nice wallbreaker. Undeniably bulky with 90/95/90 defenses, and cool Dual STAB in Water and Fighting to deal with a lot of the threats in today's metagame. Decent 85/70/70 attack stats gives it just enough power to be a viable attacker. Water Absorb is another cool ability, giving it some much needed recovery and switch-in capability when needed.
- Arguably the best Poliwrath set is the Bulk Up set, boosting it's good Defense and Attack to great levels. Belly Drum boosts it's attack sky-high, leaving little that can stop it in it's path.

Moves to be wary of
- Surf, Brick Break, Focus Punch, EQ, Psychic(!), Bulk Up, Belly Drum, Hypnosis, Ice Beam

Checks and Counters
- Poliwrath has something I like to call 4-moveslot syndrome. It's not a common syndrome yet because not all the moves are available yet, but it will be soon enough. It means that Poliwrath could REALLY use a 5th slot (and arguably a 6th slot) to make him complete. Unlike other pokemon, Poliwrath will always be missing something that he really needs (For instance, Blissey has different sets she can use, but she can be just as effective with any common set, and in fact doesn't "need" any of the other moves on a specific set. CM Bliss doesn't need Seismic Toss, Toxic Bliss doesn't need Thunder Wave, etc.)
- Slowbro makes the best switch-in, obviously. With great Defense and typing, he can switch in to any attack, even boosted ones, and 2HKO with Psychic right off the bat. He can even take Belly Drum boosted EQ, survive with 1/4 HP, then OHKO with Psychic.
- Skarmory is a good switch-in. Poliwrath just can't do much to him, and he easily gets phazed out.
- Exeggutor also makes a great switch-in. With good Defense and resistance to Fighting, Ground, Psychic, and Water, he can come in multiple times and do whatever he wants.
- To a lesser extent, Venusaur can come in like Exeggutor, and is also bulky enough to take a super effective Psychic or 2. He can then recoup the lost health with Giga Drain.
- Gengar can switch in on any of his Physical moves easily, but needs to watch out for Psychic, as with a few EV's this becomes a 2HKO, and Bulk Up Poliwrath can survive Gengar's Thunder since he usually has heavy HP/Sp. Def investment.
- Alakazam can switch in on an unboosted Brick Break, Psychic, or Surf and OHKO most Poliwrath with Psychic (Standard BU Poli has a chance to survive Psychic, and those crazy people with Max HP Max Sp. Def Poli will survive w/ 1/3 health)
- Although Flying types seem like a good idea, most Flying types take neutral damage from Fighting or are weak to Water (Gyarados aside), and Bulk Up will actually help negate his weakness to Flying (Gyarados doesn't even have a Flying type attack).
- Electric types scare Poliwrath away, but watch out for EQ on the switch.


Posted Image
Scizor
- The premier stat-up user of the current metagame. With access to 3 double stat-up moves (Agility, Swords Dance, Iron Defense), you never know what Scizor you're facing until he gets a stat advantage on you. Fantastic base 130 Attack, usable 70/100/80 defenses, and an amazing defensive typing in Bug/Steel, Scizor is unfortunately held back by it's otherwise terrible movepool. With no usable STAB Bug move, and Steel being a terrible attacking type, you'll find yourself forced to use Slash =/. Nonetheless, SD makes up for a lot of this, and he can still sweep if you're unprepared.
- Pick 1-2 stat-up moves, slap on Slash, Steel Wing, and/or Aerial Ace, and you're good to go.

Moves to be wary of
- Slash, Steel Wing/Metal Claw, Aerial Ace, Swords Dance, Agility, Iron Defense

Checks and Counters
- With Fire being his only weakness, Rapidash, Houndoom, and Charizard make great counters. Easily OHKOing with Flamethrower/Fire Blast, the only thing they have to fear is Agility on the switch followed by a crit Slash.
- Anything that may pack Fire Blast can surprise and kill him easily. Think Nidoking, Slowbro, Clefable, Snorlax, Machamp (!)
- Steel types just absolutely wall him. Magneton, Forretress, Steelix, Skarmory can all come in easily and take any attack, boosted or no. Forretress and Skarmory can easliy set up Spikes.
- Other stat-boosters have problems keeping up with Scizor though.
- Marowak has the Defense to take a hit, and can overwhelm Scizor with powerful EQs.


Posted Image
Lapras
- A very nice, all-around good pokemon. Base 130/80/95 defenses give her the approximate bulk of an Umbreon, while Base 85/85/60 give her more power and unpredictability in attacking than Umbreon. With a great ability in Water Absorb and a very wide movepool for a bulky Water, the only thing holding her back is her terrible defensive typing. Still, she's dangerous in the right hands.
- Lapras can go defensive on either side, she can go pure Special attacker or mixed sweeper.

Moves to be wary of
- Ice Beam, Surf, Thunderbolt (!), Psychic (!), Sing, Confuse Ray, Body Slam, Rest, Toxic, Double-Edge

Checks and Counters
- Although helping her get STAB on her Ice Beam, her Ice type leaves her vulnerable to powerful Fighting or Rock type moves. Poliwrath is probably her greatest threat here, since he gets a free switch-in with Water Absorb and has the bulk to survive a Thunder while 2HKOing with STAB Brick Break. Heracross also has the Special Defense to take a Psychic and 2HKO with Brick Break.
- Along those lines, strong Electric users also scare her out.
- Snorlax laughs at everything she can throw at him, and can hit hard with Body Slam or even harder with Brick Break.
- Blissey doesn't mind taking Body Slam, as Lapras doesn't have the power behind it, and walls everything else.
- Poliwrath gets a special mention as it gets a free switch-in with Water Absorb.
- Kangaskhan is bulky enough to take win the war against Lapras, hitting her hard with Brick Break or Rock Slide.
- Hypno tanks her easily, including Sing, and will slowly wear her down.
- Slowbro can set up on her with CM, slowly weakening Thunder's efficacy.
- You need to watch out for Tyranitar, since STAB SE Rock Slide hurts a lot.


Posted Image
Machamp
- A powerhouse of an attacker. Arguably the strongest physical attacker right now, he has a massive base 130 Attack stat that deals huge damage to anything that doesn't resist his attacks. He has the amazing ability in Guts, turning him into an unstoppable force when status'ed. And with good base 90/80/85 defenses, he can take a lickin' and keep on tickin'. He's also the only physical attacker that stands a chance against Skarmory. Guts-Boosted Critical Cross Chop is almost always an OHKO on Skarmory, while Focus Punch takes off a huge chuck of damage.
- 2 ways to play this guy- either all out attacker or Bulk Up sweeper. The first plays plays to his great ability, the second to his good bulk.

Moves to be wary of
- Cross Chop/Brick Break, Focus Punch, EQ, Rock Slide, Fire Blast, Bulk Up, Double-Edge/Strength, Rest

Checks and Counters
- Pokemon that rely on status are easy switch-ins for Machamp. Its arguably in your best interest to scout for Machamp by not using status the first turn you can. It's a lot harder to counter Machamp with a Gut boost, as even non-STAB neutral attacks start doing a lot of damage.
- Gengar has a pretty easy time with him. He can switch in on everything but Guts-boosted Rock Slide, then use Hypnosis/Psychic to deal with the Champ.
- Dusclops can stall out Machamp of valuable EQ and Rock Slide PP (those without Bulk Up).
- Bulky Psychic types deal well with Machamp without Guts. Exeggutor needs to worry about Fire Blast, however.
- Weezing defends Machamp well, and will win if it can avoid activating Guts with Fire Blast/Sludge/Thunder.
- Machamp has a hard time switching in more than twice without using Rest, so if you predict a Machamp switch you can just attack it hard.
- Building on the previous point, powerful neutral attacks will bring Machamp down or force him to use Rest, where he's basically set-up bait.


Posted Image
Rhydon
- My preferred choice for Rock/Ground pokemon. Great 105/120 defenses back up a gigantic base 130 Attack stat, and boy can he abuse it. He's the reason why carrying an Electric type on your team is risky business. His Megahorn also separates him from Golem as the better pokemon.
- Although Rhydon can be EV'ed in different ways, 4 attacks or 3 attacks and a utility move is usually what you'll see.

Moves to be wary of
- Rock Slide/Rock Blast, EQ, Megahorn, Focus Punch, Roar, Double-Edge, Swords Dance

Checks and Counters
- Although he has great HP, his Special Defense is terrible, so any SE Special move will easily OHKO him, it doesn't even need to be STAB.
- Other powerful STAB special attacks do tons of damage.
- He's also very slow, so most pokemon will outrun and beat him.
- Skarmory is the best counter, with immunity to STAB EQ. He has a harder time dealing with Swords Dance sets, but it's doable with Steel Wing.
- Bulky Waters are the good counters, as even an unboosted Surf will usually OHKO. Slowbro and Poliwrath work especially well because of resistances to Fighting and Rock.
- Weezing can safely switch in, as it doesn't have any physical weaknesses for Rhydon to exploit. He can then Toxic and stall him to death, and Haze away any Swords Dances.
- Marowak will outspeed and overpower him, and can easily switch in on Rock Slide.


Posted Image
Golem
- With better all around 80/130/65 defenses than Rhydon, he's the bulkier of the 2. He also has access to Explosion off base 110 Attack, which is cool, and is slightly faster.
- Similar to Rhydon, but 4 attacks are more common with Explosion being one of them. 

Moves to be wary of
- Rock Slide, EQ, Focus Punch, Explosion, Double-Edge, Roar

Checks and Counters
- Take everything you read about Rhydon, and throw it in here, minus Swords Dance. Marowak Weezing Slowbro Poliwrath Skarmory
- Explosion, while dangerous, is also very predictable (what with it being faster than Slowbro/Snorlax). Anything that resists or is immune to it makes an obvious switch-in when you know it's coming. Every Steel and Rock type should be able to take Explosion (except Aerodacty-). Max Defense Cloyster can tank Explosion at full health as well if Golem doesn't have a +Nature. Otherwise Cloyster needs true Max Defense and HP to always survive it.


Posted Image
Kingdra
- Another one similar to Kangaskhan, she has well balanced stats across the board, with 75/95/95 defenses and 95/95/85 attack. Unlike Kangaskhan, she has a worse movepool, but better defensive typing with an equally cool ability in Swift Swim. It's kind of a toss-up.
- She can go special Rain sweeper, agility sweeper, bulky sweeper, physical sweeper with Dragon Dance. A lot of options.

Moves to be wary of
- Surf, Ice Beam, Agility, Dragon Dance, Rain Dance, Double-Edge, Toxic

Checks and Counters
- Your best check against her is the fact that she has a terrible movepool. Just absolutely terrible. Her only physical move is Normal type, she doesn't get STAB attacks for Dragon, can't even get Ice Beam. Hell, Swift Swim doesn't even work yet. (Of note though: this entry is more useful once Swift Swim does work). YAY IT WORKS! And in the way of special attacks, she gets double the amount of physical types. Meaning, she only has 2 special type attacks.
- With Swift Swim implemented, she can easily outspeed everything in the Rain, and Rain-boosted STAB Surfs hurt A LOT.
- Bulky Kingdra is probably the hardest to beat. With strong defenses and only 1 weakness that's near impossible to take advantage of, this thing can last awhile, spreading Toxic, putting up Rain, and slowly whittling you down with STAB, Rain-boosted Surfs or DD-boosted Double-Edges. With Swift Swim in, she now has huge sweeping potential as a bulky AND speedy sweeper.
- Cloyster and Slowbro make the best switch-ins, resisting all of her special moves (2 moves, woohoo), while having a nice high Defense stat to take Double-Edges. Cloyster can beat it down with STAB Ice Beam while Slowbro can CM up and attempt a sweep. Cloyster can't take Surfs in the Rain though.
- Starmie can switch in easily on any special attack, but doesn't like taking Double-Edges.
- Blissey gets a special mention, as it can outlast even DD Double-Edges with Toxic and Softboiled.
- Tyranitar slows down the Rain Dance set, and can wear you down while you try to set it up.


Posted Image
Gyarados
- Oh, Gyarados. If only we could manipulate it to give you HP Flying 70, cus boy do you need it. A very bulky sweeper, it boasts 95/79/100 defenses, and a great 125 base Attack to wreck stuff. If only, HP Fly.
- Dragon dance sweeper is the way to go right now. Since you can't outspeed everything after 1 DD unless you're Jolly, you're better off going Adamant with Special Defense investment.

Moves to be wary of
- Earthquake, Double-Edge, Dragon Dance, Surf, Ice Beam, Fire Blast, Thunderbolt(!), Bite, Taunt

Checks and Counters
- Oh, HP Fly. If only. Then Gengar wouldn't be able to switch in on you with impunity and easily OHKO you with Thunder, while not really caring about Surf.
- Electric types are scared of EQ, but easily OHKO with ThunderBolt/Thunder. Jolteon is probably the best, since she can outspeed Adamant Gyarados after 1 DD (if she True Max Speed)
- Forretress makes a good switch-in as well. Watch out for Fire Blast though, which will be either a 2HKO or close to it.
- Scizor gets a mention, as it can stat up with Gyarados and then hit it's weaker Defense stat with powerful SD-boosted Slashes, while being able to take +1 EQ. Watch out for FB, a sure OHKO.
- Dusclops can come in easily and burn him with Will-o-Wisp.
- Aerodactyl gets a mention, as it can come in on most Gyarados, outspeed Adamant ones after 1 DD (again, needs truly max Speed like Jolteon), and easily 2HKO all Gyarados while being able to take a Surf.
- Dragon Dance sets need to watch out for paralysis.


Posted Image
Exeggutor
- A rather unique pokemon. Being the only pokemon with Grass/Psychic, he has the most weaknesses of any pokemon in this generation- Fire, Ice, Poison, Dark, Ghost, Bug, Flying. However, Bug, Poison, and Flying type attacks are very rare, while most Ice type users have to rely on the inaccurate Blizzard to attack. In return, you get a host of useful resistances to Water, Grass, Psychic, Electric, Fighting, and Ground. This means he can come in on most Physical attackers, special Gengar, and most importantly, Slowbro with ease. Very useful indeed.
- With useable base 95/85/65 defenses, a great base 125 Special Attack, all those handy Resistances, and a great movepool, he definitely deserves a spot on your team.
- Bulky is the way to go until Chlorophyll gets implemented. In that case, a Sunny Day sweeper is a great option as well. Bulky sweeper OR Sunny Day sweeper are both viable options.

Moves to be wary of
- Leech Seed, Sleep Powder, Psychic, Giga Drain, Solarbeam, Sunny Day, Explosion(!)

Checks and Counters
- Again, Exeggutor can put any counter to sleep, so watch out.
- Sunnybeam Eggy can also overpower almost any pokemon, especially with Sleep Powder. If Sleep Clause isn't active, Blissey doesn't stand a chance.
- He's a slow Grass type who sometimes uses Sunny Day. So fast Fire types make perfect counters. Houndoom gets a bonus for being immune to Psychic as well.
- Slowbro with Fire Blast will surprise, and sometimes OHKO, the unaware Exeggutor.
- Cacturne gets a special mention as maybe the best counter. Immune to both Psychic and Leech Seed is super nice, and the only thing Exeggutor can really do is put you to sleep or Explode on you.
- Umbreon is immune to Psychic, and can come in and Toxic/Bite Eggy to death.
- Scizor/Forretress resist both Psychic and Grass, so they can switch in relatively unharmed.
- Dodrio takes full advantage of his STAB SE Drill Peck to 2HKO all Exeggutor, and can act as a sleep absorber with Early Bird.
- Rhydon and Heracross absolutely wreck Eggy with Megahorn, easily OHKOing.
- Nidoking also gets a mention because of Megahorn. If Nidoking is max Attack then only max Defense max HP Exeggutor has a chance to survive (but not always). But Nidoking EV spreads vary wildly, so your mileage may vary against him.
- Alakazam can actually come in and set up on Exeggutor if Sleep Clause is active, and all Exeggutor can do back is Leech Seed and/or Explode.
- Kingdra takes neutral from everything, is bulky enough to take a hit, and cause havoc with Blizzard and/or Toxic.
- Tyranitar cares not for your weak Giga Drain, nor for your Sunnybeam set. Crunch just wrecks you.
- Draggy resists Grass and can carry many moves that hurt you.


Posted Image
Arcanine
-With Defenses of 90/80/80 he'll take a few more hits than you might expect if you're unprepared
-Attack stats of 110/100/95 allows him to come in physical, special, and mixed sets
-He can outspeed a wide variety of pokemon but a +speed nature takes away from either his amazing attacks or makes him less durable, most Pokemon that are faster than Arcanine can't take too many Extremespeeds- which always goes first
-He can switch in on a fire type(or a predicted fire type move) if he's packing flash fire and deal fellow fire types surprising damage with one of his signature moves(Extremespeed)

Moves to be wary of
-Flamethrower(!), Extremespeed(!), Aerial Ace, Bite(replaced with Crunch when breeding is implemented), Roar, Sunny Day, Toxic, Iron Tail

Checks and Counters
-Most special walls can take anything Arcanine throws at them (besides maybe Toxic).
-Starmie can handle Extremespeed and finish him off with a Surf.
-Bulky Waters will always force him to switch out. Slowbro beware- Bite/Crunch from a Max Special Attack Arcanine can 2HKO you if you don't take him out the first turn.
-Dugtrio outspeeds him, keeps him stuck in with Arena Trap (when implemented), and OHKOs him with Earthquake, Dugtrio is fragile so do not try to switch in on attacks
-Rhydon/Golem can take anything Arcanine can throw at them except Iron Tail and OHKO easily with STAB EQ.


Posted Image
Donphan
- One of the best Rapid Spin users around. He can spin AND hit like a truck. He's the only spinner that can really threaten Dusclops throughout the match. Base 90/120/60 give him great physical bulk, and base 120 Attack lets him fire off powerful STAB EQ's that hurt nearly everything.
- Bulky spinner is the only real way to use him right now.

Moves to be wary of
- EQ, Rock Slide, Rapid Spin, Rest, Roar, Toxic

Checks and Counters
- Skarmory can wall anything he does, and can phaze Donphan out before Donphan can phaze him out. Weezing can Toxic and wall him easily as well.
- Bulky Waters deal can handle EQ's well, and can counter with a powerful STAB Surf.
- Exeggutor resists EQ, has the physical bulk to switch in often, and can easily set up on him.
- Dusclops/Gengar block his spins. Dusclops is bulky and can burn him, while Gengar is immune to EQ and can Hypnosis him and/or attack his weaker Special Defense.
- Without Roar, he has problems with the main Bulk Up users in Machamp and Ursaring. Toxic won't help him either.
- Strong non-STAB SE special attacks will also do the trick.


Posted Image
Muk
- The other pure poison type. Overall tankier than Weezing, he has great base 105/75/105 defenses, and a cool base 105 Attack to hit stuff with. He has low Speed, and a terrible mono-Poison typing without the benefit of Weezing's Levitate. Still, he hits hard, and has a decent physical movepool.
- Physical tank is really the only way to go.

Moves to be wary of
- Sludge Bomb, Brick Break/Focus Punch, Toxic, Rest, Acid Armor, Body Slam, Explosion, Fire Blast, Thunderbolt, Taunt

Checks and Counters
- He has terrible typing. He's weak to EQ and Psychic, which almost every strong attacker has. He's hard to OHKO, but gets easily 2HKO'ed by any of them, and has a hard time killing the counter in between.
- Gengar walls nearly everything he can do, and can hit hard with Psychic or whittle it down otherwise.
- The Rock/Ground types actually wall him well, as they take little from Brick Break. Marowak
- Slowbro can tank hits really well and 2HKO easily with Psychic.
- Venusaur can come in and set up on him. Fire Blast doesn't even do all that much, and some combo of Leech Seed/Sleep Powder/EQ will take care of him.

Cloyster
- Big spikey clam of death ^_^. With a monstrous base 180 Defense, this girl tanks hits like a motherfucker. Her base 95 Attack and 85 Special Attack lets her freeze you with Ice Beam or just straight up Explode on you. A dangerous little lady, especially when you reread this bullet point with sexual innuendo.
- She has a very limited movepool, so she's predictable. She also has terrible HP and Special Defense, so she needs a lot of investment in those stats to survive even decently powered attacks.

Moves to be wary of
- Ice Beam, Surf, Explosion, Toxic, Rest, Rapid Spin

Checks and Counters
- With terrible base 45 Special Defense and 50 HP, she has a REALLY hard time taking any neutral Special Attack, so that's always your best option. Having said that, let's go into other potential checks.
- Note that she can and will Explode on anything, and it will do a nice chunk of damage thanks to her good Attack.
- Any other bulky Water, or Special Wall, can come in, tank her moves, and kill her easily with her low Special Defense (even with her resisting Surf). However, you have to watch out for the Explosion.
- Dusclops/Gengar/Misdreavus both make excellent spin blockers against her, while also blocking Explosion.
- Although her base Defense is great, her typing is not, as she has a weakness to Rock and Fighting. Machamp will outlast and 2HKO all Cloysters with Cross Chop, and OHKO those without a lot of Defense investment with Focus Punch. (Cross Chop will never crit, however, thanks to Cloyster's ability, Shell Armor)
- Marowak's Bonemerang is almost a guaranteed 2HKO on Cloyster with +Nature no EV's in Defense, but is always a 3HKO on True Max Defense and True Max HP Cloysters.
- Rhydon's Rock Slide is a 2HKO on minimally invested Cloyster, and almost always a 3HKO on Max Defense Cloyster.
- Hitmonlee has a chance of a 2HKO on both versions (with Black Belt), and gets a mention for his nice Special Defense.
- Every other Physical attacker is at least a 3HKO or more (Golem has a chance to 2HKO minimally invested Cloyster)

Vaporeon
- One of the better Eeveelutions (It goes Umbreon>Jolteon=Vaporeon>Espeon>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Flareon), she can easily be on any team that needs a bulky Water. With great 130/60/95 defenses, an amazing ability in Water Absorb, and base 110 Special Attack, she can tank some damage and dish out even more.
- Standard fare hear for a bulky Water. Has Water/Ice/Dark type attacks, can Roar and Rest, and gets access to Haze, the OG stat neutralizing move.

Moves to be wary of
- Surf, Ice Beam, Bite, Rest, Roar, Haze, Acid Armor, Toxic

Checks and Counters
- Vaporeon is a very nice wall, as its weaknesses are all against her better Special Defense. Having said that, Jolteon really scares her away with a powerful STAB Thunder. Magneton also gets a mention, as it resists everything but Surf and can launch it's own STAB Thunder.
- Grass types have a hard time staying in because of Aurora Beam/Blizzard, and that it's really hard to OHKO her without Solarbeam. However Leech Seed is super effective because of her high HP.
- Snorlax easily takes anything Vaporeon can throw at her and hit hard with STAB Body Slam.
- Umbreon as well can tank hits, but doesn't like being Toxic'ed.
- The rare Tentacruel can stop everything Vaporeon does.
- Poliwrath can hit hard with STAB Fighting while all Vaporeon can do is Roar it out.
- Starmie's Thunder is a 2HKO, but doesn't like taking Bite or repeated Surfs.


Posted Image
Weezing
- One of the better Physical walls around. Base 65/120/70 defenses don't seem like much, but his biggest advantage over all the other walls is his fantastic typing/ability combo- Poison with Levitate gives him 0 Physical weakness, an immunity to Ground, and a really useful resist in Fighting. This easily makes him the best switch-in to Marowak along with Gengar. With no physical wall really standing out from the others, this guy is poised to see a rise in usage. He also has decent 90/85/60 attack stats to hurt things with.
- Physical wall is the way to go, and boy does he do it well. Unfortunately his coolest moves are unavailable right now, but he's still usable.

Moves to be wary of
- Toxic, Explosion, Haze, Thunderbolt, Fire Blast, Sludge, Protect

Checks and Counters
- Having only one weakness to Psychic and a lower Special Defense, strong Psychic users, particularly those with STAB, scare the heck out of Weezing.
- It's almost essential that you have Fire Blast, otherwise Steel types completely own you.
- Bulky Waters in general have an easy time with Weezing, as Thunder is inaccurate while Shock Wave does little, if he even has an Electric move at all.
- Gengar makes an excellent switch-in, as he's immune to Toxic, can take a predicted Explosion, and OHKO with Psychic (Physical Gengar does ~85-90% with Psychic).
- Blissey with Refresh and all Snorlax have an easy time coming in and walling him. However, you have to watch out for Explosion, an opportunistic opponent will gladly trade KO's with you. Explosion OHKO's Blissey unless she has True Max Defense and True Max HP. Defensive Snorlaxes actually survive at full health, but any other circumstance is an OHKO.
- Strong Special Attackers can bring him down, if all else fails.


Posted Image
Umbreon
- My favorite 2nd gen pokemon (along with Ampharos/Mareep), Umbreon used to be my favorite pokemon to use in Gen 3. Unfortunately, her usually good movepool is restricted by her signature moves either not working (Mean Look, Baton Pass) or not available at lvl 50 (Moonlight), which puts her behind Bilssey/Snorlax for best Special Wall. Don't let this fool you, however. With base 95/110/130 defenses, she takes physical hits better than Blissey/Snorlax ever could. And with the main Megahorn users either not available (Heracross) or unable to use it right now (Rhydon), Umbreon essentially has only 1 weakness in fighting (like Snorlax/Blissey) but gets 2 cool resistances from Ghost and Dark attacks, and an amazing immunity to Psychic. This gal's damn near impossible to kill.

Moves to be wary of
- Toxic, Confuse Ray, Bite/Faint Attack, Rest/Moonlight, Taunt

Checks and Counters
- STAB Fighting moves, although not OHKO's (Machamp's Focus Punch aside), put the serious hurt on her, especially on Special Defense focused Umbreons.
- Other than that, Umbreon's biggest problem is a lack of being able to do much besides Toxic things.
- Taunt shuts her down hard.
- Steel types completely wall her, and can set up on her. In particular, Skarmory has no trouble setting up Spikes.
- In general, most things can set up on her.
- Although Moonlight is a better alternative to Rest, it does leave her open to status, particularly Toxic.
- Unmentioned up above, but Nidoking gets Megahorn, CAN use it well, and has a bonus immunity to Toxic. However, even max Attack Nidoking's Megahorn is a 3HKO on max Defense Umbreon, so depending on the EV's Megahorn becomes less of an issue (due to Megahorn missing 15% of the time).


Posted Image
Venusaur
- The second best Kanto starter in this gen (and arguably the best), he's seen a rise in usage with the recent starter tournament among others. Easily the bulkiest all-around Grass type available, with 80/83/100 defenses, and good 82/100/80 attack stats make this one of the most versatile pokemon around. Leech Seed deals with Blissey/Snorlax easily, while Sleep Powder can put almost any of his counter to Sleep.
- The most common version of Venusaur is the bulky Leech Seed set, which is pretty damn good. Unfortunately, Venusaur's movepool is too limited right now to do much more than variations of bulky Venusaur.

Moves to be wary of
- Leech Seed, Sleep Powder, Toxic, Sunny Day/Solarbeam, Giga Drain, Razor Leaf, Earthquake(!), Synthesis

Checks and Counters
- Exeggutor makes arguably the best counter right now. With Immunity to Leech Seed, and resistance to all of his moves, he makes a great switch-in, and can easily beat him with Psychic or use Sleep Powder himself to disable Venusaur.
- Charizard has a nice 4x resist to Grass and immunity to EQ, letting him tank Solarbeams with ease and counter with Flamethrower, but hates Sleep Powder/Leech Seed.
- Hypno has immunity to Sleep Powder, the special defense to deal with any attacks, and STAB Psychic to scare him away.
- Houndoom loves the Sunny Day Venusaur sometimes puts up, which can severely hurt your team. However, EQ makes rather short work of him, and can be unexpected.
- Gengar resists Grass, is immune to EQ, and can either hit you with a powerful Psychic or put YOU to sleep with Hypnosis.
- Super strong (Marowak), boosted (SD Scizor, CM Slowbro), or super effective attacks, particularly physical attacks, can overwhelm you if you've already activated sleep clause, since your Defenses, while good, simply can't stand up to repeated attacks like that.


Posted Image
Hypno
- Another underrated pokemon that's seen a rise in usage. The only pure Psychic pokemon available that can actually take a hit, people saw how awesome his Insomnia ability is in absorbing sleep, while being able to dish out sleep himself. However, this gift is also a curse, as Hypno would REALLY like the health recovery of Rest, since unlike almost every Psychic type he has no instant 50% recovery. Nonetheless, with a good movepool, good 85/70/115 defenses, and a great ability, you need to be prepared for him.
- Hypno's main purpose in life is to tank special hits and absorb sleep. However, there are multiple way to build around this. He can screen, he can go physical, special, mixed, support. He can suit many of your team's needs.

Moves to be wary of
- Psychic, Calm Mind, Seismic Toss, Focus Punch/Brick Break, Shadow Ball, Meditate, Reflect/Light Screen, Thunder Wave, Toxic, Hypnosis, Swagger

Checks and Counters
- Caveat to all of the below points (as with any sleep inducer): Hypno can sleep any of them, making them all less effective than stated. You've been warned.
- Talk to anyone who's used Hypno extensively, and they'll tell you- Toxic is the bane of Hypno's existence. With no way to recover HP nor remove the poison, Toxic will cripple Hypno. Just make sure you don't accidentally paralyze him, since you rid yourself of the easiest way to beat him.
- Defensive Umbreon makes a great switch-in. Immune to Psychic, easily takes multiple unboosted Focus Punches coming in (Meditate Hypno rarely has any Attack EV's), and will cripple Hypno with Toxic.
- Slowbro makes another nice switch-in, as it resists both of his main attacks and doesn't mind Toxic/Paralysis. Watch out for Hypnosis.
- Hypno is slow, usually has a -Speed nature, and is not great defensively. What? Is that Marowak's theme song I hear playing?!
- Exeggutor can take on Hypnos without Calm Mind and Toxic, as it resists both of his attacks.
- Physical Gengar handles Hypnos without Psychic easily (and to a lesser extent, special Gengar as well)
- Steel types (Scizor, Steelix, Forretress) are immune to Toxic, resist Psychic, and are tanky enough to take any Focus Punches.
- Banette gets the rare mention here, because it itself also has Insomnia, is immune to Focus Punch, will destroy Hypno with STAB Shadow Ball, and takes neutral damage from Psychic (unlike Gengar). However even then it can't take many hits in general, and will lose by like 4 or 5 speed points if neither has invested in Speed.
- Blissey can Toxic, and can shrug off a Focus Punch or 2. After Toxic hits, she just needs to spam attacks to avoid any more Focus Punches.
- All else fails, strong neutral physical attacks can overwhelm non-Reflect Hypnos, and Brick Break can remove Reflect.


Posted Image
Forretress
- A fantastic physical wall. With base 140 Defense and 0 physical weaknesses, physical sweepers have a hard time doing anything to this beast. Overall, he only has 1 weakness, making him one of the best all around tanks available.
- Forretress has an incredibly limited movepool right now. He basically has some utility moves, Double-Edge, and Explosion. Zap Cannon is an option, but a terrible one.

Moves to be wary of
- Explosion, Double-Edge, Light Screen, Reflect, Zap Cannon, EQ, Sandstorm (He really doesn't have much to do) Spikes, Rapid Spine, Rest

Checks and Counters
- Like Scizor, his typing leaves him with one huge weakness: Fire. Any STAB Fire move will OHKO always, and Light Screen will only protect you from really weak Fire Blasts.
- With 75/140/60 defenses, you can take advantage of him with strong, neutral special attacks, especially if they get STAB. As such, bulky Waters make a great switch in, as they take little damage from everything Forretress has (even Zap Cannon), and can hit hard with STAB Surf.
- Brick Break users get a special mention, as they destroy the screens that Forretress commonly set up.
- Gengar/Dusclops can come in at will. Gengar only fears the paralysis from Forretress, while Dusclops fears nothing. Forretress tanks almost all their attacks well, but will lose because of Hypnosis/Will-o-Wisp
- Scizor is the only pokemon who can really set up on Forretress, because of his resistance to Explosion (and the lack of that resistance with other set up sweepers). Bulkier versions can withstand the Explosion while setting up.
- Credit to Forretress' Defense, as Marowak can only beat it if it lacks Reflect. Great physical bulk, to withstand Marowak.
- Steelix wins against him, as he has better Defense AND a STAB move that hits neutrally.
- Forretress' biggest problem is being unable to stop his opponent from setting up other than by Exploding. It's fine if you're taking out Slowbro, but less so when you're stuck against, say, Leech Seed Exeggutor/Venusaur.
- Any potential switch-in needs to watch out for Zap Cannon's paralysis (especially Gengar coming in on a predicted Explosion)


Posted Image
Steelix
- A ridiculous physical wall. With an absurd base 200 Defense (tied for second highest in gen 3), this guys tanks all manner of physical hits. EQ's are often 4HKO's or worse, especially without STAB, which is a testament to how great he is.
- You would obviously only use him as a wall. However good base 85 Attack and near perfect neutral coverage in SlideQuake make him less of a sitting duck than other walls like Forretress, Cloyster, or Weezing.

Moves to be wary of
- Earthquake, Rock Slide, Iron Tail, Rest, Toxic, Roar, Double-Edge, Explosion

Checks and Counters
- Physically, only Marowak, Machamp, Heracross, and Rhydon/Golem will beat him (and Rhydon/Golem can't come in on EQ or Iron Tail). Everyone else is either not bulky enough or strong enough to beat him.
- Strong STAB Fire or Water attacks take him down quickly. But even then it's rare to get the OHKO as he commonly goes max HP with a lot of Special Defense (Kind of like Blissey with Defense), so watch out. Grass and Ice also hit neutrally, so bulky Grass types can outlast him with Leech Seed/Sleep Powder/Giga Drain.
- Every other type is resisted. It'll be tough unless you get a few CM's under your belt.
- Don't bother even with +6 Attack if you can't hit him SE. I'm looking at you, Scizor.
- The rest basically depends on the moveset.
- Skarmory absolutely walls him, and will phaze him out because of his higher speed.
- Without Rest, repeated switches will wear him down.
- Without Roar/Explosion, you can set up on him.
- Without Rock Slide, Ground immune pokemon have an easy time coming in, as otherwise Steelix has to rely on the terrible Iron Tail, Toxic, or Explosion. (Basically just asking for Gengar to switch in and Hypnosis).


Posted Image
Dusclops
- An unusually made pokemon. Amazing base 130 Defense AND 130 Special Defense is offset by terrible base 40 HP. (FYI if your opponent doesn't go max HP, jump for joy). A true all-around wall, he can go either great defending one stat, or pretty good defending both. Decent base 70 Attack, an interesting stalling ability in Pressure, and good utility moves make him a unique and noteworthy threat.
- With the advent of Rapid Spin he's now the best spinblocker available.
- Base 40/130/130 defenses mean he can go either way. A common strategy is to EV for Special Defense and then carry Will-o-Wisp to deal with physical attackers.

Moves to be wary of
- Shadow  Ball, Focus Punch, EQ, Will-o-Wisp, Night Shade/Seismic Toss, Toxic, Confuse Ray, Calm Mind/Psychic/Blizzard (the last 2 should only be run with Calm Mind)

Checks and Counters
- The best way to overcome Dusclops is to set up on it. Slowbro makes a great check, as it takes little even from STAB SE Shadow Punch or resisted Bilzzard/Psychic, gets 5HKO'ed by Night Shade, and will slowly beat Dusclops, especially if it has PP Ups. It's a close, stally battle, however, that favors Slowbro if only because you can't crit if you're asleep.
- Machamp/Ursaring/Heracross loves the burn or posion Dusclops commonly deals out, and can either come back later to deal damage, set up with Bulk Up, or beat it down with powerful boosted EQs.
- Houndoom gets a special mention as it can come in on anything except Focus Punch or Toxic and easily beat it with Crunch. (W-o-W will activate Flash Fire)
- Charizard can come in, set up Sunny Day, and beat it with boosted Flamethrower (Fire Blast will run out of PP)
- Special Tyranitar doesn't care about Burn, and can make your life miserable with Sandstorm and STAB SE Crunch.


Posted Image
Quagsire
- The sevii islands gave us access to a bunch of new pokemon, including this cool guy. A bulky water by any definition he has one of the best typings in the game (Water/Ground), giving him only 1 weakness to Grass, and some nice resistances to Fire, Steel, Rock, Poison, and Sandstorm (!), and an immunity to Electric. His cool ability Water Absorb also makes him immune to the otherwise neutral Water attacks. He can handle nearly every other bulky Water, and then some.
- It's a good thing he has great typing, because his stats aren't great. Base 95/85/65 defenses aren't too bad, and base 85 Attack is decent, but good luck hurting much with base 65 Special Attack and dreadful base 35 Speed.
- His movepool isn't too bad with some decent offensive options and some interesting defensive ones.

Moves to be wary of
- EQ, Surf, Ice Beam, Brick Break/Focus Punch, Sludge Bomb, Haze (!), Rest, Amnesia, Safeguard, Toxic

Checks and Counters
- Any Grass type attacks will nearly always OHKO, even non-STAB'ed ones. Think of this as being similar to Rhydon/Golem (he's only slightly more Special Defensively bulky than Golem). He does have a move to hit every STAB user super effectively (Sludge Bomb and/or Blizzard)
- He can be overwhelmed by strong neutral attacks, especially on the Special Defensive side, but not by Stat-uppers (thanks to Haze). If he doesn't carry a move that can hit you for SE damage, than you can probably outlast him.
- Slowbro/Slowking can come in relatively easily, but can't do anything to Quaggy's with Haze (Haze has more PP than Calm Mind).
- Skarmory/Forretress can come in on and set up on it with Spikes. Skarmory can then Roar for Spikes damage.
- He can be outstalled easily.


Posted Image
Nidoking
- Nidoking does one thing, and one thing well- break walls. He's easily the most versatile pokemon offensively outside of the base 600 club (Dragonite/Tyranitar/Salamence) You never know what you can expect from Nidoking (even more so than Gengar!). He can learn Fire Blast, Surf(!), Blizzard (!), Shock Wave/Thunder(!!!) on the special side, while learning EQ, FP/BB, and Megahorn. Immunity to Toxic AND Thunder Wave is also rare, as Steelix is the only other pokemon that can boast about it.
- With very useable 92/85//85 attack stats, he can go special, physical, or mixed with max speed on all versions.

Moves to be wary of
- EQ, FP/BB, Megahorn, Fire Blast, Surf, Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, Double-Edge, Shadow Ball, Rock Slide, Toxic, Roar, Hyper Beam (for teh lulz)

Checks and Counters
- In general, countering Nidoking is really simple. Anything faster with a SE powerful move can OHKO him easily, even non-STAB moves. Think EQ, Psychic, Surf, Blizzard. However, because of his huge movepool, no pokemon can really be considered a safe switch-in. He is the very definition of a wall-breaker.
- His biggest weakness is that he relies on getting a SE hit to do a lot of damage. Any pokemon that takes neutral damage from all his moves (and that's not frail like, say, Alakazam) can switch-in easily.
- Max defense Umbreon stands maybe the best chance of switching in as it can take a Megahorn/Focus Punch. However it has very little that it can do, since it's immune to Toxic.
- With immunity to all of his common physical, Gengar makes a great switch-in, and can force it out with Psychic.
- Dusclops takes little damage from all his attacks, and can burn him with Will-o-Wisp.
- Machamp is also bulky enough to take a hit and KO with EQ.


Posted Image
Clefable
- Should you ever find yourself up against the Fairy Pokemon, remain calm. You're going to have to figure out what you're up against, as Clefable is one of the most versatile, unpredictable pokemon in the entire game and can run a number of dangerous sets. Its respectable defenses at 95/73/90 allow it to take quite a few hits, while its attacking stats of 70/85/60 can be deceiving due to the sheer number of moves available.
- Clefable can run a physically offensive set (Double-Edge, Focus Punch/Brick Break, Meteor Mash), a specially offensive set with Calm Mind (Fire Blast, Psychic, Shock Wave/Thunder, Water Pulse, Blizzard), a Toxic-Stalling Cosmic Power set, and can even be played as a straight up Anti-Sweeper with Thunder Wave/Seismic Toss. He can also set up Light Screen/Reflect to help another team mate set up.

Moves to be wary of (lol)
- Fire Blast, Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, Psychic, Meteor Mash, Double Edge/Return, Focus Punch/Brick Break, Shadow Ball, Seismic Toss, Calm Mind, Cosmic Power, Rest, Softboiled, Toxic, Thunder Wave, Sing, Shock Wave, Water Pulse, Reflect, Light Screen, Sunny Day/Solarbeam

Checks and Counters
- This can be tricky, because until you know what you're up against you can't be sure what exactly you'll want to do to either take down or force out Clefable. Like any bulky Normal type, strong Fighting or other physical moves are usually the most effective.
- Bulk Up Machamp with HP/Special Defense investment is easily the best switch-in to all Clefable. Bulky enough to take +1 Psychic, it will one-shot offensive Clefable while taking little from defensive Clefable and 2HKOing back straight up, or he can Bulk Up against Cosmic Power and attempt a sweep. He also enjoys the paralysis/Toxic stalling Clefable commonly has.
- Anything with about ~200 Attack can beat Cosmic Power/Rest sets with a combination of Focus Punch and a strong STAB move (think Rhydon, Marowak)
- Should you encounter a stalling Clefable with Seismic Toss, Gengar is a very strong pokemon against it, as Clefable will not be able to do much of anything for as long as Gengar is on the field. Muk, Weezing and Immunity Snorlax are all good options here as well, due to their ability to resist Toxic. You can try to simply overpower it, as this Clefable won't be much of a damage dealer, but if it has been allowed to set up at all, phazing it out with Roar/Whirlwind and dealing with it later is really the best option available to you.
- Against a Calm Mind Clefable, strong physical attackers like Marowak, Machamp or Snorlax will get the job done. This Clefable can't boost its Defense, and by the time it sets up enough Calm Minds to do a dangerous amount of damage you'll have likely either forced it to rest, switch out, or it'll be on the floor unconscious.
- A physically offensive Clefable is normally the simplest to deal with. Once you've seen a Clefable start throwing out Meteor Mashes or Double-Edges at you, just switch in something that won't take much damage from it like Rhydon, Golem, Snorlax or hell even Starmie, and you'll either level it or force it out.
- If you discover Clefable has Thunder Wave, you've probably just gotten one of your sweepers crippled, which sucks. Send in a ground type, a pokemon with Limber, or a slow pokemon that doesn't mind the paralysis such as Snorlax (are you seeing a theme here yet?), Slowbro or Dusclops.
- Don't forget Brick Break will destroy any screens Clefable may set up.
- Be fucking thankful Encore, Substitute and Counter don't work yet, because it learns those too.

Kangaskhan
- A fantastic, underrated pokemon. An extremely well-rounded pokemon, she has no relevant stat under 80(!), boasting 105/80/80 defenses and 95/x/90 attack. She also has access to Early Bird, making her an amazing 1-turn Rester and/or a great sleep absorber.
- She can fill out plenty of roles: she can go fast sweeper, bulky sweeper, a specialized wall.

Moves to be wary of
- Double-Edge, Rest(!), Dizzy Punch, Shadow Ball, Body Slam, Endure/Reversal, Seismic Toss, Earthquake, Focus Punch, Rock Slide, Brick Break, Fake Out (!)

Checks and Counters
- One of Kanga's problems is that she gets overwhelmed by a lot of sweepers if she's not specialized in the defensive stat. She's above average to good in every stat, but not great in anything: a proverbial Jack of all Trades, Master of None.
- Building off that point, strong, dedicated physical walls can stop her cold: Think Steelix, Cloyster, Forretress, Skaamory. Anything with good physical bulk that is EV'ed defensively.
- Be careful if you're at low health. She is the only legitimate user of Fake Out right now, so if it's her first (relatively) turn out, she can outspeed you with a decently powered Fake Out, KOing you at worst or at the very least flinching you. Note that relatively means that each new time she switches in, she can use Fake Out that first turn.
- STAB Fighting puts the hurt on her, easily.
- Gengar is immune to everything but Rock Slide from her, and so he makes a relatively safe switch-in (he can't rely on Hypnosis though because of Early Bird).
- To a lesser extent, Dusclops makes a good switch-in and can burn her with Will-o-Wisp, forcing a Rest and proceeding to Focus Punch her.
- Slowbro gets a special mention since it not only has the bulk to come in and set up on her, it has the great ability in Own Tempo to negate Dizzy Punch's confusehax.

Electrode
- Nicknamed Godtrode for a reason (well, I do), with godly base 140(!) Speed, he's the fastest available pokemon and one of the fastest overall. Speed-boosting pokemon typically don't account for him, which is nice when you still outspeed them after 1 boost (I'm looking at you Gyarados) or after 2 (I'm also looking at you, Scizor/Exeggutor). Unfortunately, otherwise subpar stats and an equally subpar movepool limit him. Fast Explosion is nice though.
- Obviously he's just all out attacker. Even with some investment, he can't really take a hit.

Moves to be wary of
- Thunder/Thunderbolt, Explosion, Light Screen, Thunder Wave, Rain Dance

Checks and Counters
- Any Ground/Rock or Ground/Steel type. Immune to Electric and high Defense make Explosion a joke.
- Dusclops cares not for anything GodTrode can do. Gengar doesn't like paralysis, but can come in on Explosion and/or Break Screens.
- Exeggutor/Venusaur resist Electric, and aren't dealt much damage by Explosion.
- Blissey/Snorlax don't care about anything he does (and Blissey welcomes paralysis.) Base 50 Attack is REALLY bad.
- Anything with EQ that can take a Thunder. Base 60/70/80 defenses are also pretty bad.


Posted Image
Octillery
-With 105/105 base attacking stats and a strong movepool, Octillery is a viable mixed sweeper who can deal considerable damage if he is switched in at the right time.
-His 75/75/75 defensive stats won't allow him to stand up to a lot of sustained damage. Pure water typing leaves him vulnerable to grass and electric attacks, which can be problematic.
-Depressingly low speed (45) combined with his lackluster defenses are abusable by a smart opponent. His speed can be made up for up if you Thunder Wave a switch in.
-Suction cups comes in handy if you can predict when your opponent is going to attempt to phaze.

Moves to be wary of
-Sludge Bomb, Ice Beam/Blizzard, Psychic, Surf, Fire Blast, Thunder Wave, Double-Edge

Checks and Counters
- He gets easily walled by most special walls. He really doesn't have enough power to threaten Blissey, Umbreon, etc.
-Starmie can force a switch out since it often carries Thunder and resists all of Octillery's special attacks. Thunder will most often not kill a full health Octillery in 1 hit, but it will deal a huge chunk of damage. He doesn't like T-Wave though.
-Blissey completely walls Octillery and often has Toxic, which will cripple you if you do not switch out.
- Slowbro can easily switch in and set up on him.
- Strong STAB Electric attacks will easily down him.
- He's easily overpowered by any sweeper he can't hit super-effectively.


Posted Image
Banette
- An interesting Ghost type. He's the only Ghost type that can truly take full advantage of his typing, as he has the strongest Shadow Ball in the game. Base 115 Attack is nuts on a Ghost type, and base 83 Special Attack is decent as well. His nature makes him a great Sleep absorber as well, and one of the safest switch-ins to Hypno. Base 64/65/63 defenses don't do him any favors, and neither does his base 65 Speed. His movepool is one of the worse this side of Tauros. But as anyone who faced Volpi in the Starter Tourney can tell you, he can do some damage.
- Physical attacker or a mixed set, although he really needs all the Speed he can get.

Moves to be wary of
- Shadow Ball, Will-o-Wisp, Knock Off (not available yet), Hyper Beam (yeah, it's not even terrible for him), Calm Mind, Psychic, Thunderbolt, Taunt

Checks and Counters
- He gets walled easily. Any physical wall can take all of his attacks. Most of them don't like being burned, nor their item removed, however.
- Physical Gengar outspeeds and KO'es him with Shadow Ball. Dusclops can burn him back, Rest off the burn, and then Shadow Punch him.
- Strong, neutral STAB attack easily down him, it doesn't matter what attacking stat.
- Bulky normal types with Rest can come in easily and beat him up. Special Clefable is the best at this, as she doesn't care about Burn.

Ninetails
- One of the most popular Fire types, vying for everyone's attention over Charizard and Arcanine. Base 100 Speed make her speedy, and base 100 Special Defense makes her underrated as a special tank- she can take most non-STAB surfs, for example, and some STAB ones. The rest of her stats scream mediocre, however, and she has the common terrible movepool problem most Fire types have. She's easily the best utility Fire type, however, so be careful.
- Specially bulky, speedy, attacker, any of these are possible.

Moves to be wary of
- Flamethrower/Fire Blast, Will-o-Wisp, Confuse Ray, Sunny Day, Dig, Iron Tail, Roar

Checks and Counters
- Anything with strong Ground or Rock moves. Unless you have Guts though, you need to be careful about W-o-W. Tyranitar Marowak Golem 
- She is easily walled by the game's special walls.
- Slowbro can easily set up on her with Own Tempo. Bulky Waters in general don't have problems with her. Vaporeon Kingdra Politoed Gyarados 
- Fire types can come in easily, fishing for a Flash Fire boost.

Vileplume
-An underrated pokemon and a good support pokemon with great moves in Sleep Powder and Aromatherapy (Vileplume is the only viable user of this move as the only other Pokemon available that can learn it is Parasect.) A mini-Venusaur, with decent 80/100/50 attack stats and 75/85/90 defense stat.  Though not quite as bulky as everyone's favorite dino bud, it can still take a hit and can boost its speed with its cool ability Chlorophyll.
-You'll most likely see Vileplume fulfilling a support role, though SunnyBeam is an option.  You may also run into a physical attacking set.

Moves to be wary of
-Sleep Powder, Stun Spore, Toxic, Moonlight, Aromatherapy, Sunny Day, Solar Beam, Sludge Bomb, Giga Drain, Swords Dance, Double Edge

Checks and Counters
-Scizor, Forretress, and Skarmory make the safest switch-ins resisting anything other than sleep or paralysis that Vileplume can throw at them.  (Magneton is a safe one as well, but doesn't have much to hit back with.)
-Muk and Weezing make good switch-ins since they resist grass/poison, are immune to toxic and can hit back with neutral STAB Sludge Bomb or Fire Blast.  They just don't wanna get slept.
-Guts users can take advantage of the status Vileplume sometimes throws out on the switch.
-Anything resistant to its STAB attacks that can hit back with a powerful SE or STAB SE attack makes a great counter. (Crobat, Skarmory, Gengar)
-Hypno resists sleep and can hit back with SE STAB Psychic.
-Charizard and Dragonite take 1/4x damage from grass type attacks and can hit back with STAB SE attacks.
-The boost to fire type attacks from Sunny Day can backfire on you if your opponent can take advantage of it.
-Vileplume has no way to boost its defenses, so boosted neutral attacks can overpower it.
-Once Sleep Clause has been activated and if Sunny Day isn't up outspeed it's pitiful base 50 stat and hit it with SE attacks.

Cacturne
- A rather niche pokemon, similar to Banette in terms of stat distribution.
- An excellent near 100% Counter to majority of Psychic Pokemon, and Gengar who don't run Brick Break!
- Hes a amazing Mixed Sweeper sporting 115 base Special Attack and Physical Attack stats!
- Has a chance to almost OHKO Snorlax (about 90%), OHKO Blissey and deal massive damage to Umberon (roughly 60%) who are all common switch ins on Cacturne with Focus Punch!
- Can easily 1v1 Slowbro/king (even if stacked with a couple Calm Minds) and Umberon (who don't get lucky with confuse ray) if carrying the proper movesets.
- Makes both yourself and your enemy sweat as hes a high pressure Pokemon who plays as a "High Risk, High Award" play style. Cacturne awards you greatly/punishes you incredibly hard depending on your predictions.
- Makes your enemy Psychic Pokemon and Gengar feel like jerks when they wimp out leaving the rest of their team to tank hard hitting Focus Punches

Moves to be wary of
- Focus Punch (!), Giga Drain/Needle Arm, Faint Attack, Double Edge, Hyper Beam, Leech Seed, Swords Dance, Spikes

Checks and Counters
- Mostly anything that Cacturne isn't resisted/immune to type wise will OHKO Cacturne thanks to his awful defense and hit points. Most of these types are Physical while majority of mixed sets run -Defense natures. You can abuse this to your advantage forcing your opponent's Cacturne to switch or die. Some of these Pokemon are listed below.
- Tentacruel can tank a few hits from Cacturne and scare the Cactus away with Ice Beam/Blizzard/Sludge Bomb. Liquid Ooze is also pretty funny and helpful.
- Alakazam (or anything) with Focus Punch will OHKO Cacturne if you predict that Cacturne will switch in on you
- Crobat tanks Focus Punches/Giga Drain incredibly well thanks to his 4x resistances to fighting and can sweep the Cactus away any day.
- Heracross yells "come at me bro!" resisting Faint Attacks/Giga Drains/Focus Punches and retaliate back with a Megahorn (4x Super Effective) or Brick Break to the face.
- Fireblast Slowbro/king is a funny surprise to a Cacturne and OHKO's (poor guy...). Watch out for Destiny Bond however as Cacturne is faster!
- Skarmory tanks Giga Drain/Faint Attack easily while only shrugging off Focus Punches damage. He doesn't like getting Seeded, but can hit hard with Aerial Ace.
- Dragonite resists Focus Punch and Giga Drain/Needle Arm, and can carry any number of moves to hurt Cacturne with.
